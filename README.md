# stackmapsource

**NOTICE:** This is a modified version of the excellent `stacktracify` CLI-tool, created by: [mifi/stacktracify](https://github.com/mifi/stacktracify)

Have you ever been faced with a stacktrace that looks like this?

```
TypeError h is not a function. (In 'h()', 'h' is undefined) 
    main.jsbundle:954:5353 
    main.jsbundle:112:423 p
    main.jsbundle:112:1740 
    main.jsbundle:112:423 p
    main.jsbundle:112:898 n
    main.jsbundle:112:1273 
    main.jsbundle:50:205 c
    main.jsbundle:50:1623 b
    main.jsbundle:50:488 _
    [native code] value
    [native code] value
```

...perhaps from production from a minified web JS bundle, Angular or React Native error report.

**stackmapsource takes a source map and a stack trace from stdin and outputs a readable stacktrace with proper line numbers for each line**

Example output:
```
TypeError h is not a function. (In 'h()', 'h' is undefined) 
    at getAuthToken (logic/api.js:67:20)
    at authRequest (logic/api.js:127:8)
    at data (logic/SaveQueue.js:30:20)
    at op (logic/SaveQueue.js:43:29)
    at __callImmediates (node_modules/react-native/Libraries/BatchedBridge/MessageQueue.js:143:11)
```

## Install

```
npm install -g stackmapsource
```

## Usage

**Pipe a minified stacktrace to stackmapsource:

```
echo "TypeError h isâ€¦" | stackmapsource /path/to/js.map
```
